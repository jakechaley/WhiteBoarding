Question #3: Compressing Strings

Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "aaabccdddda"

Output: "3ab2c4da"

function compressedString(string){
  let stringArray = string.split('');
  let newArray = [];
  let counter = 1;
  for(let i=0; i < stringArray.length; i ++){
    if(stringArray[i] === stringArray[i+1]){
    counter += 1;
    }
    else{
      if(counter >= 2){
          newArray.push(counter + stringArray[i]);
          counter = 1;
        }
        else{
          newArray.push(stringArray[i]);
        }
      }
    }
    console.log(newArray.join(''));
}
