Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs

URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

//ReplaceAll will look at the string
//replaces every space with %20

let string = "Jasmine Ann Jones"

function createURL(sting) {
  return string.replaceAll(" ", "%20")
}

function above works
