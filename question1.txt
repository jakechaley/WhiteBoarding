Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs

URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"

SOLUTION NOT USING REGEX:

//use split method to split string on spaces. 
//use join method to create new string with %20 in place of spaces

function creatURL(sting) {
  return string.split(" ").join("%20")
}

//the above function returns:
// "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"
// "Jake%20C%20Haley"
// "I'm%20going%20to%20the%20store"






THIS SOLUTION USES REGEX WHOOPS

//ReplaceAll will look at the string
//replaces every space with %20

let string = "Jasmine Ann Jones"

function createURL(sting) {
  return string.replaceAll(" ", "%20")
}

function above works
